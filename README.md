# Memory-Allocation-Simulator

### To run the program, follow these instructions:

1. Run the following command in the terminal to compile the relevant files 
```bash
make all
```
2. Run the command `./memorySimulation` to run the generated executable

### Current program
- The current test runs on the routine 'implementBestFit'
- To try the worst-fit algorithm, replace 'implementBestFit' with 'implementWorstFit' and run step 1 and 2 again
- To try the first-fit algorithm, replace 'implementBestFit' with 'implementFirstFit' and run step 1 and 2 again
